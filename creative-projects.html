        I have many hobbies, but my favorite has to be making things. More specifically,
        I like making dragons. And drawing dragons. Basically anything that involves dragons. 
        You get the point. Oh, and before you ask: yes, I have read Wings of Fire and yes, I 
        liked the series.

        Actually, it was the cover art and the dragons in the book series that first inspired
        me. I learned how to draw dragons by copying them. Since then, I've moved on to drawing
        and creating more original things, but most of them are still dragons.

            I draw lots of dragons. Everywhere. Spare papers, margins, and notebook covers are all
            commonly vandalized by me. But out of all of them, these are my favorites.

           Recently, I got some alcohol markers. However, my usual art style wouldn't work very well
           with them, so I tried something a little different and created some characters that used a
           new style. Overall, I think that they turned out pretty well.

           I've also leared how to properly draw hands, heads, and human beings in general. It's the
           first time that I have freehand drawn people, but after learning the proportions, it was
           much easier than before.

          Here are some heads. I'm too scared to try putting faces on them though, so they don't
          fall into the uncanny valley zone.

            This was one of my first hand made costumes involving fabric. I made it back in 2022
            and it shows. The fabric isn't on quite right, there are visible hot glue strands and
            gaps in the fabric, and its overall not great. It will always be special to me though.

            This was made a couple years later. Taking a break from fabric, I experimented with plastic
            shrubbery and chicken wire, making for a unique costume. That made it very uncomfortable,
            but beauty is pain and it was worth it. Learning to walk with the arm stilts was a learning
            curve, but it got really fun when I learned how to run.

            I made this on <a href="https://www.beepbox.co">BeepBox</a> during class one day because I
            stick it on my website. Pretty cool! I think it loops too much, but considering the amount
            of time I had, its not that bad.
