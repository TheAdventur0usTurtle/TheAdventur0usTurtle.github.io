        I have many hobbies, but my favorite has to be making things. More specifically,
        I like making dragons. And drawing dragons. Basically anything that involves dragons. 
        You get the point. Oh, and before you ask: yes, I have read Wings of Fire and yes, I 
        liked the series.

        Actually, it was the cover art and the dragons in the book series that first inspired
        me. I learned how to draw dragons by copying them. Since then, I've moved on to drawing
        and creating more original things, but most of them are still dragons.
