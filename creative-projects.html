        I have many hobbies, but my favorite has to be making things. More specifically,
        I like making dragons. And drawing dragons. Basically anything that involves dragons. 
        You get the point. Oh, and before you ask: yes, I have read Wings of Fire and yes, I 
        liked the series.

        Actually, it was the cover art and the dragons in the book series that first inspired
        me. I learned how to draw dragons by copying them. Since then, I've moved on to drawing
        and creating more original things, but most of them are still dragons.

            I draw lots of dragons. Everywhere. Spare papers, margins, and notebook covers are all
            commonly vandalized by me. But out of all of them, these are my favorites.

           Recently, I got some alcohol markers. However, my usual art style wouldn't work very well
           with them, so I tried something a little different and created some characters that used a
           new style. Overall, I think that they turned out pretty well.

           I've also leared how to properly draw hands, heads, and human beings in general. It's the
           first time that I have freehand drawn people, but after learning the proportions, it was
           much easier than before.

          Here are some heads. I'm too scared to try putting faces on them though, so they don't
          fall into the uncanny valley zone.
