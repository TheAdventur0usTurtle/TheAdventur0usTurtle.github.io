        Hello There! I'm just your friendly neighborhood Adventur0usTurtle! 
        Maybe this text will wrap around to a new line, but there's only one way to find out.
        He he, I've added enough text and it works! What if I change the size of the window?
        Yup, still good. Wow this website is pretty bland.
        It is in <em>desperate</em> need of some CSS. Hey, I'm <em>trying</em>, ok?
        I <strong>promise</strong> this website will look at least a little bit more decent 
        in the future.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Hey look at that! I just added a couple new lines with HTML! Nice!

      A Lil' Bit About Me and this Goofy Little Website of Mine
    </h2>
    <p> Hi. So like I said earlier in "My Completely Arbitrary Thoughts", I am TheAdventur0usTurtle,
      and here are some mildly interesting things about me in case you were wondering. One thing is that
      I love simple games. Things like sudoku, pong, tetris, and snake.
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+minesweeper&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1178US1178&oq=google+minesweeper&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDwgAEEUYORiDARixAxiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDQ4ODdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sei=7NS5aOiMObjg0PEPksnyoQQ&safe=active&ssui=on">
        This one's my favorite my favorite though.
      </a>
      They are basically my life on a 
      long boring day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      Another thing you'd probably know about me if you've spent any time at all poking around on my 
      website is that I love making things, drawing things, painting things, all sorts of things like that.
      So far, the "things" I make have been getting improving, so I'm always looking forwards to my next big
      project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      Then again, that might be in part due to the fact that I'm procrastinating much less, so I have
      more time to invest in the quality. Usually, I'd begin a week before the deadline and it'd work day and
      night while the final product turns out really janky. I have improved with my planning though, so hopefully,
      my next masterpeice will turn out a lot better.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this applies to homework as well.
      the general rule for me is the larger the project, the more time I have to do it, and the less I want to
      start on it, the more I procrasinate. I really really despise large projects in school because I'd much
      prefer to just finish everything in one sitting then having to streatch out the misery across multiple
      grueling days.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do, however, like making this website. Even though it is a big long project, it is the ONLY class project.
      Well, not entirely the only - we have to do some codepip practice too - but the website is the main big thing.
      It's also very self paced with a few requirements that I have to occasionally meet just to prove I was at 
      least partially listening. But those I can just finish right away as soon as they are assigned and just be done
      with them. Speaking of my website...
