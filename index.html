        Hello There! I'm just your friendly neighborhood Adventur0usTurtle! 
        Maybe this text will wrap around to a new line, but there's only one way to find out.
        He he, I've added enough text and it works! What if I change the size of the window?
        Yup, still good. Wow this website is pretty bland.
        It is in <em>desperate</em> need of some CSS. Hey, I'm <em>trying</em>, ok?
        I <strong>promise</strong> this website will look at least a little bit more decent 
        in the future.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Hey look at that! I just added a couple new lines with HTML! Nice!

      A Lil' Bit About Me
    </h2>
    <p> Hi. So like I said earlier in "My Completely Arbitrary Thoughts", I am TheAdventur0usTurtle,
      and here are some mildly interesting things about me in case you were wondering. One thing is that
      I love simple games. Things like sudoku, pong, tetris, and snake.
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+minesweeper&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1178US1178&oq=google+minesweeper&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDwgAEEUYORiDARixAxiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDQ4ODdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sei=7NS5aOiMObjg0PEPksnyoQQ&safe=active&ssui=on">
        This one's my favorite my favorite though.
      </a>
      They are basically my life on a 
      long boring day.

  <div class="align-left">

      Another thing you'd probably know about me if you've spent any time at all poking around on my 
      website is that I love making things, drawing things, painting things, all sorts of things like that.
      So far, the "things" I make have been getting improving, so I'm always looking forwards to my next big
      project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="align-center">
    <p>
      Then again, that might be in part due to the fact that I'm procrastinating much less, so I have
      more time to invest in the quality. Usually, I'd begin a week before the deadline and it'd work day and
      night while the final product turns out really janky. I have improved with my planning though, so hopefully,
      my next masterpeice will turn out a lot better.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="align-right">
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this applies to homework as well.
      the general rule for me is the larger the project, the more time I have to do it, and the less I want to
      start on it, the more I procrasinate. I really really despise large projects in school because I'd much
      prefer to just finish everything in one sitting then having to streatch out the misery across multiple
      grueling days.

      I do, however, enjoy making this website. Even though it is a big long project, it is the ONLY class project.
      Well, not entirely the only -we have to do some codepip practice too- but the website is the main big thing.
      It's also very self paced with a few requirements that I have to occasionally meet just to prove I was at 
      least partially listening. But those I can just finish right away as soon as they are assigned and just be done
      with them. Speaking of my website...

      This Goofy Little Website of Mine
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is my totally super awesome project for the first semester of my computer programming 1/2 class. I've been
      addign quite a bit to it outside of class though, so it's become more of a personal project for me now. I've
      always wanted to make my own website, I never knew exactly where to start with it. Learning the basics from 
      scratch has been incredibly helpful. In fact, "My Completely Arbitrary Thoughts" at the top of this page on my website
      contains my first thoughts on HTML, where I was writing down anything that came to mind because I needed to write 
      something to meet the class requirenment.
    </p>

      The layout may look a bit wonky right now, but it will make more sense once
      I add more to the website. Eventually, I would like to have a little orange car with a pen attatched to the back
      of it to drive around and draw on it. In the more distant future, I'd like to create another website from scratch for
      posting (and potentially selling) my projects online. More specifically, doing small costume part comissions. I still
      would need to learn how to set up a payment system that works and is secure, but I can definitely make the website look
      visually appealing and functional with the skills that I currently have.

      If you are a particularly techy person, you may be wondering how I created this cool/weird staggering effect. It was
      actually pretty easy. I broke down the webite into three distinct columns, so its easier think about. Then, I set a 
      maximum width for every element, with headings being slightly wider than the body text to make it visually appealing.
      After that, I created three classes, one for each column. In CSS, I aligned them using "align-items". However, since this only
      applies to the children of an element, I have to wrap each element in a div and THEN assign a class to it. Other than that,
      that's pretty much it.
