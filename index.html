    Hello There! I'm just your friendly neighborhood Adventur0usTurtle! Maybe this text will wrap around to a new line, but there's only one way to find out. He he, I've added enough text and it works! What if I change the size of the window? Yup, still good. Wow this website is pretty bland. It is in desperate need of some CSS. <br> <br> hey look at that! I just added a couple new lines with HTML! Nice!
