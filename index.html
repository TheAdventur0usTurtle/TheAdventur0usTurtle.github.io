    Hello There! I'm just your friendly neighborhood Adventur0usTurtle! 
    Maybe this text will wrap around to a new line, but there's only one way to find out.
    He he, I've added enough text and it works! What if I change the size of the window?
    Yup, still good. Wow this website is pretty bland.
    It is in <em>desperate</em> need of some CSS. Hey, I'm <em>trying</em>, ok?
    I <strong>promise</strong> this website will look at least a little bit more decent 
    in the future.
    <br> 
    <br>
    Hey look at that! I just added a couple new lines with HTML! Nice!

    About Me and this Goofy Little Website of Mine
  </h2>
    <p> Hi. So like I said earlier in "My Completely Arbitrary Thoughts", I am TheAdventur0usTurtle. 
      Here some mildly interesting things about me if you were wondering. I don't know about you, but
      I love the google browser games.
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+minesweeper&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1178US1178&oq=google+minesweeper&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDwgAEEUYORiDARixAxiABDIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDQ4ODdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sei=7NS5aOiMObjg0PEPksnyoQQ&safe=active&ssui=on">
        This one's my favorite.

        That's Sam ----> <br>
        She's currently sitting next to me as we both program our goofy websites. <br>
        She doesn't know it yet but I'm about to draw her on the whiteboard table becuase <br>
        I want to and also it gives me something to write about on my website here. She's pretty <br>
        awesome by the way.

        Then there's Olivia <br>
        We're the crazy robotics girlies. **She's a lot more crazy about it than I am though; the <br>
        robot is practically her child** Oh and also, she writes a lot. Like, a LOT a lot. As in, I <br>
        seriously know how it is physically possible to write that much, but she does. Magik maybe.
