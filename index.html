        Hello There! I'm just your friendly neighborhood Adventur0usTurtle! 
        Maybe this text will wrap around to a new line, but there's only one way to find out.
        He he, I've added enough text and it works! What if I change the size of the window?
        Yup, still good. Wow this website is pretty bland.
        It is in <em>desperate</em> need of some CSS. Hey, I'm <em>trying</em>, ok?
        I <strong>promise</strong> this website will look at least a little bit more decent 
        in the future.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Hey look at that! I just added a couple new lines with HTML! Nice!

      About Me and this Goofy Little Website of Mine
    </h2>
      <p> Hi. So like I said earlier in "My Completely Arbitrary Thoughts", I am TheAdventur0usTurtle,
        and here are some mildly interesting things about me if you were wondering. I don't know about you, but
        I love games with simple graphics and rules. I'm a personally fan of things like sudoku, pong, tetris, 
        and snake. They are basically my life on a long boring day.
