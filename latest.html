            This is my most recent project, a full sized dragon shoulder puppet. It took a
            bit over a month to make. So far though, it is one of my favorites and turned out
            the best. It is also took the longest compared to the others.

            Here is some concept art from about a month before I began the project. I've had
            the idea of creating a dragon shoulder puppet a year in advance, but the design
            wasn't finalized until this first sketch.

    <div class="align-right">
        <p>
            I started by creating a scale drawing of the design to help me visualize the task
            and also to use for reference. Later, I would end up using the paper outline to create 
            the  pattern for the body, which I traced out onto the fabric and cut out.

            I began working on the limbs. They were made from soft green upholstery, which I pain stakingly
            carved by hand for days. It didin't have to be green, but its the only color I had on hand at 
            the time. The limbs were about the same length as mine. I ended up making four, two for each side.
        </p>
    </div>

     <div class="align-center">
        <p>
            Now is a good time to mention that everything I do here has to be mirrored
            and done twice, since I'm working in three dimentions and I have to make the other side.
        </p>

            I also added wires connecting the different parts of each finger and each finger to the
            rest of the hand. Yes, the fingers were segmented and the idea was to make the hands, wrists,
            and ankles posable. It didn't end up working out as well as I'd hoped though.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="align-left">
        <p>
            The next step was to cover all of the foam peices in masking tape. I would draw on and label
            the patterns in sharpie, including the location of the peice, fabric color, and fur direction.
            This might seem like overkill, but with so many weidly shaped parts, it can quickly get out of
            hand.

    </div>

    <div class="align-center">
        <p>
            Then, I would cut out the patterns and sort them by color. These will be traced out onto the
            fabric so that it can be cut out and sewn back together. Since the pattern is symetrical, all
            I needed to do was to pattern one half and then flip over the peices and trace them onto the fabric
            again to created a mirrored copy that would fit the other side.

            This took weeks, but I didn't end up having enough time to add them onto the final project,
            and it would have made the entire thing too bulky, so the final product didn't include the 
            limbs and I've just wasted a few weeks an a ton of foam and effort.
        </p>

      <div class="align-center">
        <img src="Assets/pinto_5.jpeg" alt="progress picture of Pinto the dragon puppet's head" class="single-border">

    <div class="align-right">
        <p>
            After the limbs, I began working on the head this was by far the most complex portion of
            this project, since I needed a working jaw hindge and enough space for the throat. I made
            it using EVA foam because it needed to be hollow and as lightweight as possible, while also
            being ridgid enough to maintain its shape.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="align-center">
        <p>
            The head underwent a similar process to the limbs, being covered by tape to later be cut and
            traced onto the fabric. While I taped the entire head, I really only needed half, since I could
            have flipped the pattern to get the symetrical other side.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="align-center">
        <img src="Assets/pinto_4.jpeg" alt="progress picture of Pinto the dragon puppet's head covered in masking tape" class="single-border">
    </div>

    <div class="align-left">
        <p>
            After cutting out all of the fabric, I was nearly done with the project. The last part was
            putting it all together. The fabric on the face was hot glued onto the EVA foam, while the
            body was sewn into essentially a long fluffy sock and stuffed with poly-fil.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="align-right">
        <p>
            In addition, I also added a sleeve running through the body in order to be able
            to stick my arm through and control the puppet. To make it easier to take on and
            off, the head is seperate from the body. With that, the puppet is finished and
            ready to wear!
